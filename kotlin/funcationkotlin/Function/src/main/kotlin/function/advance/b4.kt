/*WAP to solve the following problem of perfectworld.
Think of a perfect world where everybody has a
soulmate.
Now, the real world is imperfect: there is exactly one
number in the array
that does not have a pair. A pair is an element with
the same value.
For example in this array:
1, 2, 1, 2
every number has a pair, but in this one:
1, 1, 1
one of the ones islonely.
Your task is to implement the findPairless() function
so that it findsthe
lonely number and returns it.*/
